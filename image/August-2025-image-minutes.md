### Agenda

* Updates/recap from GloBIAS
    - [Learning objectives](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12i0M9cLdX0WyMFvlAewYa0NtKs7F1Ek4FnPqKhAGqZE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.32cs2nujswlu)
    - Integrated into the lesson draft (online here https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/bioimage-analysis-python/index.html)
    - Held monthly online meetings so far (except for August).
    - Currently looking at a dataset to use through the lesson. Nicolas & Szymon have led the hunt for an appropriate dataset. Identified a candidate and responding to feedback at the moment.
    - Next steps likely to be drafting episodes based on LOs defined already. 
    - Next meeting 15 September

* Idea/suggestion from last [maintainer coworking meeting](https://codimd.carpentries.org/dc-image-processing-coworking?both#2025-08-07-Co-Working)
    - Alternative capstone challenge [#346](https://github.com/datacarpentry/image-processing/issues/346)
        * Marco brought up idea about pill counting
            * may be more relatable
            * there are options for extensions (identifying size, shape, color)
        * opportunity to differentiate from BioImage curriculum
        * Caveat: "medication" example could make people uncomfortable
          * MC: no strong opinion on this. Inclined not to discount it due to the possibility that you *might* make people uncomfortable.
	  * TH: Include a couple of sentences on context of the example and its relation to practical applications, then it should be fine.
        * Give Josh and Eric a chance to chime in.

* Carpentries community discussions on AI curriculum
    * Related recent blog post: <https://carpentries.org/blog/2025/08/genai-curriculum-discussions/>
    * Two working groups forming, for different workshops
        * a "user workshop": to teach people about the use of genAI tools for coding/data science
        * a "developer workshop" to teach people about how to implement "AI" methods in their software/data analysis
    * Focus is on what The Carpentries should teach about these things.
    * Challenges with citation/attribution of AI generated content.
    * Worth keeping an eye on since it may effect what gets discussed in our workshops and increasing use of genAI for open source contributions could impact Maintainers.
    * Draft SPEC from Scientific Python project https://github.com/scientific-python/summit-2025/issues/35

* Related to above: interest in adopting <https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/machine-learning-neural-python/index.html>? (Toby)
    * Incubator lesson on neural networks in python
    * Example is a model that classifies chest X-rays, diagnosing pleurisy
    * Q: Could this be added to the DC as a follow-up lesson?
        * Reviews/opinions welcome.
        * Incubator lesson uses OpenCV. DC lessons should be consistent?
        * Potentially invite developers to next CAC meeting.

* Next CAC meeting [November 26, 2025, 20:00 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=CAC+Meeting+DC+Image+Processing&iso=20251126T20)
